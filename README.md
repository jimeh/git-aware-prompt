# Git Aware Prompt

Working with Git and its great branching/merging features is
amazing. Constantly switching branches can be confusing though as you have to
run `git status` to see which branch you're currently on.

The solution to this is to have your terminal prompt display the current
branch. There's a [number][1] [of][2] [articles][3] [available][4] online
about how to achieve this. This project is an attempt to make an easy to
install/configure solution.

## Overview

If you `cd` to a Git working directory, you will see the current Git branch
name displayed in your terminal prompt. When you're not in a Git working
directory, your prompt works like normal.

## Installation

Clone the project to a `.bash` folder in your home directory:

```bash
mkdir ~/.bash
cd ~/.bash
git clone git://github.com/jimeh/git-aware-prompt.git
```

Edit your `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.profile` or `~/.bashrc` (for Ubuntu) and add the following to the top:

```bash
export GITAWAREPROMPT=~/.bash/git-aware-prompt
export MAX_BRANCH_NAME_SIZE=30
source "${GITAWAREPROMPT}/main.sh"
```


## Configuring

Once installed, there will be new `$git_branch` and `$git_dirty` variables
available to use in the `PS1` environment variable, along with a number of
color helper variables which you can see a list of in [colors.sh][].

### Suggested Prompts

Below are a few suggested prompt configurations. Simply paste the code at the
end of the same file you pasted the installation code into earlier.


#### Mac OS X

```bash
export PS1="\u@\h \W \[$txtcyn\]\$git_branch\[$txtred\]\$git_dirty\[$txtrst\]\$ "
```

Optionally, if you want a nice pretty prompt when using `sudo -s`, also add
this line:

```bash
export SUDO_PS1="\[$bakred\]\u@\h\[$txtrst\] \w\$ "
```


#### Ubuntu

Standard:

```bash
export PS1="\${debian_chroot:+(\$debian_chroot)}\u@\h:\w \[$txtcyn\]\$git_branch\[$txtred\]\$git_dirty\[$txtrst\]\$ "
```

Colorized:

```bash
export PS1="\${debian_chroot:+(\$debian_chroot)}\[\033[01;32m\]\u@\h\[\033[00m\]:\[\033[01;34m\]\w\[\033[00m\] \[$txtcyn\]\$git_branch\[$txtred\]\$git_dirty\[$txtrst\]\$ "
```

#### Windows

```bash
export PS1="\[\033]0;$MSYSTEM:\w\007\033[32m\]\u@\h:\[\033[33m\w \[$txtcyn\]\$git_branch\[$txtred\]\$git_dirty\[$txtrst\]\033[0m\]\$ "
```
