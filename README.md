# Git Aware Prompt

Working with Git and its great branching/merging features is
amazing. Constantly switching branches can be confusing though as you have to
run `git status` to see which branch you're currently on.

The solution to this is to have your terminal prompt display the current
branch. There are a [number][1] [of][2] [articles][3] [available][4] online
about how to achieve this. This project is an attempt to make an easy to
install/configure solution.

## Overview

If you `cd` to a Git working directory, you will see the current Git branch
name displayed in your terminal prompt. When you're not in a Git working
directory, your prompt works like normal.

This fork by joeytwiddle also:
- shows you how far your local branch is **ahead** or **behind** the repository's branch
- shows how many files are **staged**
- indicates when you have an un-popped **stash** (when the top stash entry was made on the current commit or the current branch)
- displays when you are on a **detached** commit, or paused during a merge, rebase or cherry-pick
- adds a **timeout** for slower machines so that you will get your prompt quickly, even if `git status` is taking too long to retrieve the dirty and staged stats. (Tested in bash and zsh.)

If you *only* want the ahead/behind marks (no timeout and no staged stats), you may prefer the branch [ahead_behind](https://github.com/joeytwiddle/git-aware-prompt/tree/ahead_behind) or if you are curious about the code, see [ahead_behind_simple](https://github.com/joeytwiddle/git-aware-prompt/tree/ahead_behind_simple) ([compare](https://github.com/joeytwiddle/git-aware-prompt/compare/jimeh:518685d5d42ab9f298207dd66bbc213775c5cbee...ahead_behind_simple?expand=1)).

The initial implementation of the timeout feature is on [this commit](https://github.com/joeytwiddle/git-aware-prompt/commit/29a89c1e6890689c819303ad33ef70ae4233589c).

![Git Branch in Prompt](https://raw.github.com/joeytwiddle/git-aware-prompt/master/preview.png)

> `<3` indicates that the local branch is 3 commits behind the upstream/remote branch, and could be updated.

> `*2` indicates that the branch is now dirty, with 2 files modified but not committed.

> `>1` indicates that the local branch has 1 commit which has not yet been pushed.

> `+1` would indicate that you have staged 1 file before comitting, but that is not shown above.

> `?4` would indicate that there are 4 untracked files in the tree, also not shown.

> `#` indicates that `git status` was taking too long, so dirty `*` staged `+` and untracked `?` markers will not be shown this time.  `git status` will continue running in the background, so after a few moments, hitting `<Enter>` again should give you an up-to-date summary.

> `(s)` is a reminder that the top stash was made on the current branch, or the current commit.

The symbols (or "markers") can be changed by editing the `prompt.sh` file directly (and reloading it of course).  The numbers or the markers can be omitted by removing the `_count` or `_mark` variables from the `PS1` prompt below.

## Installation

Clone the project to a `.bash` folder in your home directory:

```bash
mkdir ~/.bash
cd ~/.bash
git clone git://github.com/joeytwiddle/git-aware-prompt.git
```

Edit your `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.profile` or `~/.bashrc` (for Ubuntu) and add the following to the top:

```bash
export GITAWAREPROMPT=~/.bash/git-aware-prompt
source "${GITAWAREPROMPT}/main.sh"
```


## Configuring

Once installed, there will be new `$git_branch` and `$git_dirty` variables
available to use in the `PS1` environment variable, along with a number of
color helper variables which you can see a list of in [colors.sh][].

[colors.sh]: https://github.com/jimeh/git-aware-prompt/blob/master/colors.sh

### Suggested Prompts

Below are a few suggested prompt configurations. Simply paste the code at the
end of the same file you pasted the installation code into earlier.


#### Mac OS X

```bash
export PS1="\u@\h \W\[$txtcyn\]\$git_branch\[$bldgrn\]\$git_ahead_mark\$git_ahead_count\[$txtrst\]\[$bldred\]\$git_behind_mark\$git_behind_count\[$txtrst\]\[$bldylw\]\$git_stash_mark\[$txtrst\]\[$txtylw\]\$git_dirty\$git_dirty_count\[$txtrst\]\[$txtcyn\]\$git_staged_mark\$git_staged_count\[$txtrst\]\[$txtblu\]\$git_unknown_mark\$git_unknown_count\[$txtrst\]\$ "
```

Optionally, if you want a nice pretty prompt when using `sudo -s`, also add
this line:

```bash
export SUDO_PS1="\[$bakred\]\u@\h\[$txtrst\]\w\$ "
```


#### Ubuntu

Standard:

```bash
export PS1="\${debian_chroot:+(\$debian_chroot)}\u@\h:\w\[$txtcyn\]\$git_branch\[$bldgrn\]\$git_ahead_mark\$git_ahead_count\[$txtrst\]\[$bldred\]\$git_behind_mark\$git_behind_count\[$txtrst\]\[$bldyellow\]\$git_stash_mark\[$txtrst\]\[$txtylw\]\$git_dirty\$git_dirty_count\[$txtrst\]\[$txtcyn\]\$git_staged_mark\$git_staged_count\[$txtrst\]\[$txtblu\]\$git_unknown_mark\$git_unknown_count\[$txtrst\]\$ "
```

Colorized:

```bash
export PS1="\${debian_chroot:+(\$debian_chroot)}\[\033[01;32m\]\u@\h\[\033[00m\]:\[\033[01;34m\]\w\[\033[00m\]\[$txtcyn\]\$git_branch\[$bldgrn\]\$git_ahead_mark\$git_ahead_count\[$txtrst\]\[$bldred\]\$git_behind_mark\$git_behind_count\[$txtrst\]\[$bldyellow\]\$git_stash_mark\[$txtrst\]\[$txtylw\]\$git_dirty\$git_dirty_count\[$txtrst\]\[$txtcyn\]\$git_staged_mark\$git_staged_count\[$txtrst\]\[$txtblu\]\$git_unknown_mark\$git_unknown_count\[$txtrst\]\$ "
```


#### ZSH

```zsh
export PROMPT='%n@%m:%~%{$bldpur%}$git_branch%{$bldgrn%}$git_ahead_mark$git_ahead_count%{$bldred%}$git_behind_mark$git_behind_count%{$bldylw%}$git_stash_mark%{$txtrst$txtylw%}$git_dirty$git_dirty_count%{$txtcyn%}$git_staged_mark$git_staged_count%{$txtblu%}$git_unknown_mark$git_unknown_count%{$txtrst%}$ '
```

#### Windows

```bash
export PS1="\[\033]0;$MSYSTEM:\w\007\033[32m\]\u@\h:\[\033[33m\w \[$txtcyn\]\$git_branch\[$txtred\]\$git_dirty\[$txtrst\]\033[0m\]\$ "
```
