# Git Aware Prompt

Working with Git and its great branching/merging features is
amazing. Constantly switching branches can be confusing though as you have to
run `git status` to see which branch you're currently on.

The solution to this is to have your terminal prompt display the current
branch. There's a [number][1] [of][2] [articles][3] [available][4] online
about how to achieve this.

I based this project mainly on Aaron Crane's [solution][1].

## Overview

If you `cd` to a Git working directory, you will see the current Git branch
name displayed in your terminal prompt. When you're not in a Git working
directory, your prompt works like normal.

## Installation

Clone the project to a `.bash` folder in your home directory:

```bash
mkdir ~/.bash
cd ~/.bash
git clone git://github.com/jimeh/git-aware-prompt.git
```

Edit your  `~/.profile` or `~/.bash_profile` and add the following to the top:

```bash
export GITAWAREPROMPT=~/.bash/git-aware-prompt
source $GITAWAREPROMPT/main.sh
export PS1="\u@\h \w \[$txtcyn\]\`__git_ps1 \"(%s)\"\`\[$txtred\]\$git_dirty\[$txtrst\]\$ "
```

Optionally, if you want a nice pretty prompt when using `sudo -s`, also add
this line:

```bash
export SUDO_PS1="\[$bakred\]\u@\h\[$txtrst\] \w\$ "
```

The new prompt will take effect beginning in your next session. This usually
means logging out completely. To enable it in your current session, you can
simply run `source ~/.profile` or `source ~/.bash_profile` (whichever you
edited above) in your terminal.


## Configuring

If you followed the above installation instructions, you've added the default
prompt style already by defining the `PS1` variable. If you don't know how to
customize your prompt, I recommend you check [this][5] how-to.

[5]: http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/howto-linux-unix-bash-shell-setup-prompt.html

Basically, to have the current Git branch shown, simply add `$git_branch` to
your `PS1` variable, and make sure the variable value is defined with double
quotes. A set of color variables have also been set for you to use. For a list
of available colors check `colors.sh`.


## Updating

Assuming you followed the default installation instructions and cloned this
repo to `~/.bash/git-aware-prompt`:

```bash
cd ~/.bash/git-aware-prompt
git pull
```
